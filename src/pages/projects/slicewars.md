# Background

Growing up in the early 90's, during the hay day of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, turtle-power was unavoidable. Cartoons, movies, music, theatre... the heroes in a half shell were everywhere, and I loved every second of it. As any TMNT fan knows, if theres anything the ninja turtles were known for it was their love of pizza. Cartoon pizza is always perfect, the pie is always hot and the cheese is always melty. I have spent my life searching for the perfect ninja turtles pizza always coming up short, thus it is with great pleasure I present to you:

(I cannot wrap my head around why if you make pizza and hot dogs, the choice to go with hot dog for main image was made.)
